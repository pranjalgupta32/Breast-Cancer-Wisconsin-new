# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset and Model

## Summary

This repository contains the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset along with the code for training and evaluating machine learning models on the dataset. 
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign.

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
These features include measures of tumor size, shape, and texture.

The code provided allows you to preprocess the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and train several machine learning models. 
It also includes code to evaluate the trained models using relevant metrics such as accuracy.

## Installation and Usage

To use this code and dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git


2. Run the code files in your preferred Python environment to preprocess the dataset, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Models and Evaluation

The code provides the flexibility to train and evaluate different machine learning models on the breast cancer dataset.
Some of the models you can try include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

For evaluation, the code includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
These metrics help assess the performance of the models in classifying breast tumors.

Feel free to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or additional features to add, please submit a pull request. 
Let's work together to enhance the predictive accuracy of breast cancer classification models.
